# Simple Supply

This is a simple, generic, inventory tracking app designed for the iPad that can be used to create “Products” using “Materials” and handle how much of each are available at any given time. It utilizes SwiftData to retain data through the app being opened and closed. 


Created over the course of a few days (spread out over the course of a few months), the project is fairly simple, but I am continuing to add more work. 


## On the Horizon
REDOING THE README
	This current readme is okay, but doesn't show anything off. I'll be adding images and/or videos soon to revamp this.

FIXING ISSUES
  	The issues in the issues tab are going to be fixed, "soon"

MVVM
	The code has grown to the point where adding View Models is necessary to clean up the code and improve readability. 
 	This is lower on the list of priorities, as it's mostly just for me, but it is going to happen before any of the new features get added
